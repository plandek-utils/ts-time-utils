## [2.0.0](https://github.com/plandek-utils/ts-time-utils/compare/v1.1.1...v2.0.0) (2020-04-15)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* In v1.x dayjs objects were supported. This ended up being problematic because of
issues with dayjs versions. It also added a dependency that is not strictly needed. That's why from
v2.x on dayjs is no longer supported and it is removed as a dependency

### Features

* drop dayjs support + ensure unfreeze time if errors ([807e4b5](https://github.com/plandek-utils/ts-time-utils/commit/807e4b515580c8f2cd9e6799b4eff5bc32413500))
